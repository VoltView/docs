## Overview

The Bill Validation API provides essential validation capabilities for non-domestic utility bills, helping UK businesses ensure they are not overpaying due to errors in their energy invoices.

## Key Endpoints

The Bill Validation API offers two primary endpoints:

### Parse Invoice

The parsing endpoint allows you to extract data from utility bills without requiring association with your sites or meters. This is useful for:

- Quickly digitising paper bills
- Exploring the capabilities of our data extraction engine
- Preparing data for manual validation workflows

<CodeGroup>
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.voltview.co.uk/v1/billValidation/parse \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@invoice.pdf"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Validate Invoice

The validation endpoint allows you to check an invoice against your site data, tariffs, and meter readings to identify potential errors. This endpoint:

- Extracts all data from the invoice
- Compares it against expected values from your tariffs and contracts
- Identifies discrepancies in consumption, rates, and charges
- Returns a detailed validation report

<CodeGroup>
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.voltview.co.uk/v1/billValidation/validate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@invoice.pdf" \
  -F "siteId=123" \
  -F "meterId=456"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Common Use Cases

- **Invoice Verification**: Quickly check invoices before payment to prevent overpayments
- **Multi-site Validation**: Manage and validate bills across multiple properties efficiently
- **Error Identification**: Detect common issues such as incorrect consumption data, billing errors, and wrong tariff applications
- **Cost Recovery**: Identify historical overcharges for potential refund claims

## Integration with Your Systems

The Bill Validation API is designed to integrate seamlessly with your existing processes:

1. **Upload invoices** as soon as they're received
2. **Review validation results** to identify potential issues
3. **Take action** on flagged errors to recover costs
