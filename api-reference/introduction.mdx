## Getting Started

To start using the VoltView API, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a VoltView account to receive your API credentials
2. Review our data granularity options (hourly/daily/monthly)
3. Ensure your requests are sent via HTTPS

All API responses are returned in JSON format.

## Authentication

The VoltView API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to secure all endpoints.

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer your-jwt-token"
}
```

### Token Management
- Generate a JWT token using your API credentials
- Include the token in the Authorization header
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Invalid tokens return a 401 Unauthorized response

### Authentication Error Response
If authentication fails, you will receive an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response with a detailed error message in the JSON response body.
