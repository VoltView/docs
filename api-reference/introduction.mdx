## Getting Started

Register for a VoltView account to receive your API credentials [**__here__**](https://docs.voltview.co.uk/register).

## Authentication

The VoltView API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to secure all endpoints.

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer your-jwt-token"
}
```

### Token Management
- Generate a JWT token using your API credentials
- Include the token in the Authorization header
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Invalid tokens return a 401 Unauthorized response

### Authentication Error Response
If authentication fails, you will receive an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response with a detailed error message in the JSON response body.

## Data Units

The VoltView API uses the following standardized units across all endpoints:

| Metric | Unit |
|--------|------|
| Energy Consumption | kWh |
| Power Demand | kW |
| Carbon Emissions | kg CO2eq |
| Currency | GBP (Â£) |
| Time Series | ISO 8601 format |
| Numeric Values | Rounded to 2 decimal places |
| Meter Point Numbers | MPAN/MPRN format |
| Supplier Read Frequency | Minutes/Hours/Days |
| Reading Type | Actual/Estimated |
