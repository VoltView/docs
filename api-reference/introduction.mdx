## Getting Started

Register for a VoltView account to receive your API credentials [**__here__**](https://docs.voltview.co.uk/register).

## Authentication

The VoltView API supports two authentication methods:

### Supabase Auth (Web and Mobile Users)

Web and mobile applications authenticate via Supabase Auth. After signing in with a magic link or OTP code, include the access token in the Authorization header:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer your-supabase-access-token"
}
```

### API Key (Server-to-Server Integrations)

For programmatic access, include your API key directly on every request:

```json
{
  "x-api-key": "your-api-key"
}
```

No token exchange is required. The API key authenticates directly on every endpoint.

### Authentication Error Response
If authentication fails, you will receive an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response with a detailed error message in the JSON response body.

## Data Units

The VoltView API uses the following standardized units across all endpoints:

| Metric | Unit |
|--------|------|
| Energy Consumption | kWh |
| Power Demand | kW |
| Carbon Emissions | kg CO2eq |
| Currency | GBP (£) |
| Time Series | ISO 8601 format |
| Numeric Values | Rounded to 2 decimal places |
| Meter Point Numbers | MPAN/MPRN format |
| Supplier Read Frequency | Minutes/Hours/Days |
| Reading Type | Actual/Estimated |
