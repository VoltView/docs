## Authentication Methods

The VoltView API supports two authentication methods:

### 1. Supabase Auth (Web and Mobile Users)

Web and mobile applications authenticate via Supabase Auth using magic links and OTP codes.

After signing in, include the Supabase access token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.voltview.co.uk/v1/sites \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <supabase_access_token>"
```

### 2. API Key (Server-to-Server Integrations)

For programmatic access, include your API key in the `x-api-key` header on every request:

```bash
curl https://api.voltview.co.uk/v1/sites \
  -H "x-api-key: your_api_key_here"
```

No token exchange is required. The API key authenticates directly on every endpoint.
